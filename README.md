# Overview

An enjoyable golang test framework.

## Features

- Pretty output using [gop](lib/gop) and [diff](lib/diff)
- Fluent API design that takes the full advantage of IDE
- Handy assertion helpers
- Handy utils for testing
- No dependency, and 100% test coverage

## Guides

Read the [example project](lib/example) to get started.

Got uses itself as the test framework, so the source code itself is the best doc.

Install the [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ysmood.got-vscode-extension) for snippets like: `gt` and `gts`.

API reference is [here](pkg.go.dev/github.com/ysmood/got).
